# Evaluation Tool for Teachers

The final assignment for Codaiseur Academy was to build an Evaluation Tool for Teachers. The ExpressJS API also made as part of the assignment can be found [here](https://github.com/laraanna/evaluation-api)

## Features

* Algorithm part; As a teacher I can click a button to pick a 'random' student to ask a question. Not entirely random though: RED students get ~50% of the questions YELLOW students ~33%, and GREEN students ~17%.
* As a teacher I can sign in
* As a teacher I can see (and add) current classes (aka batches) and its students
* As a teacher I see the percentage of students evaluated green, yellow and red
